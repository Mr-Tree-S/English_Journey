# Comprehensible Input

It is a language acquisition theory developed by Stephen Krashen. It emphasizes the importance of understanding language input that is slightly above the current level of the learner, often referred to as "i+1". This approach suggests that learners acquire language more effectively when they are exposed to material that is understandable yet challenging.
