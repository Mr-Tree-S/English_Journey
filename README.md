# English_Journey

I got CET-4 in 2014, but after that I didn't pay much attention to English.
I started to pick it up again in 2022, cause I joined PwC a global company and I need to use English in my daily work.
But the progress is slow, so I decided to make English learning as the first priority in my life.
And I will record my learning process here.

## Methodology

Comprehensible Input

It is a language acquisition theory developed by Stephen Krashen. It emphasizes the importance of understanding language input that is slightly above the current level of the learner, often referred to as "i+1". This approach suggests that learners acquire language more effectively when they are exposed to material that is understandable yet challenging.
