# in tip-top shape

This expression is me now. I mean these days, despite the fact that I am getting older.
How old are you? Oh, that's a rude question.
But People often ask me, Coach Shane, how old are you?
40? Haha, NOnononono, I'm actually 56. Can you believe that? Yeah, I'm 56.
But people say I don't look it. Thank you if you said that. Thank you so much.

I'm in tip-top shape. Almost.
I could lose a bit of weight, but actully, I'm in tip-top shape.
Do you know that means?
Oh such a good expression. It's really good expression.
I think you can maybe kind of understand what it means to be in tip-top shape.
I will explain after the dialogue, but ler me explain even a little bit brfore.
So I don't exercise much, but I eat very well. And I do drink a little bit of alcohol, but not much.
I do like my coffee, and my vitamins and stuff like that.

Check out the dialogue.
Another beer?
Sure. I exercise today.
Uh, you are getting fat. I'm worried about your health.
Ah, I'm in tip-top shape. Don't worry.
You know me, I like my beer, and every evening I do have a beer. It's a reward, I love the taste.
My wife hates the taste of beer, but I certainly love it.
Yeah, I think relatively I am in tip-top shape.
You know, I'm 56 years old, I'm not 22 when I was doing triathlons. I'm not like that anymore, but I am getting better.
I think I am actually getting healthier as I go along.
To be in tip-top shape means to be in really good condition, espacially physical condition.
But again, mental condition, emotional condition, all of those conditions.
If you are feeling great, then you are in tip-top shape. Yes, you are.
So how do you feel? mentally, physically, emotionally?
Do you feel good? Do you feel strong? Do you feel tough? Do you feel like you are the best you have ever been?
Well, that's probably not possible. Once again, I'm 56. I am not going to be running any marathons, but I do believe I am in tip-top shape.
Thanks in great part to my wife who keeps my diet nice and clean.
What about you? Are you in tip-top shape? I certainly hope you are.
