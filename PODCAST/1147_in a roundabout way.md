# in a roundabout way

Today's expression is really great.

This is the phrase. In a roundabout way. So it's like the word round and the word about.
So in a roundabout way. What does this mean? It's actually really simple, the definition.
And I'll give you the definition after we check out the dialogue.
And I got to tell you guys, I just took advantage of this and I want you to take advantage of it too.

Let's check out the dialogue.
Tim really loves you.
He never tells me.
He just says it in a roundabout way.
How?
Like when he said ... I like being bored with you. That's his way.

Guys, is it easy for you to say I love you to your girlfriend, to your wife? Is it easy?
Me? what do you guys think? Do you think I say I love you? Yeah, probably not enough, right?
I said it to my boys. No, no, actually, I do say it quite a bit.
But you know that really, like, look in the eyes type thing?
Honey, I love you.
Yeah I'm not, I don't do that, that's weird to me.
But yeah I mean, I married my wife of course I love her. I got my two monkeys, of course I love them.

But if you're like kind of me, and well, maybe worse than me, if you don't say I love you, then how does the other person know that you actually love them?
That's a good question, because some people want to hear those words.
So maybe you show your love or maybe you say I love you in a roundabout way.
In a, or rather, in a indirect way.
If you say it directly, I love you.
But if you it indirectly, you might say I like being bored with you. I like just sitting here with you. I like taking a walk with you. I like sitting on the couch watching TV with you. I like having coffee with you.
These are indirect ways of saying I love you between a man and a wife, right?
Indirect way. A roundabout way. That's exactly what it means.
You go around the subject. What are you talking about? What are you going around and around?
Let's kind of think about that. What are you talking about?
You're going around and around to talk about how, in this case, you love the person in a roundabout way.
It doesn't mean I love you. In a roundabout way simply means an indirect way of saying something.

So when a guy wants to break up with a woman, you konw, the guy should say, I want to end our relationship.
But many times, the guy will say, you know, you deserve a better person than me.
That's a roundabout way of breaking up.
Just be direct. Right, guys? Guys, you're direct, right?
I'm sure you are.
Ladies, my wife is so direct, it's scary.
My wife is never... She thinks that I'm always saying things in a roundabout way.
Am I? Oh my God, I hope not.
That's today's expression.
